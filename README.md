Game Programming Assignment: Networking

I Created this multiplayer game using the tutorial found at:
https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/multiplayer-networking

I copied the very simple models, and the basic instructions
to create functioning net code, but I created my own game on
top of the network.

Instead of a shooter, I created a game where the combat is based
around "goomba-stomping" your opponent. Each player has a small 
white dot above its head, and if a player manages to hit an 
opponent's dot with their body, they earn 30 points. The catch is
that it costs a point every time you jump.
